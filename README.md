### Emotions available in the dataset: 'neutral','calm','happy','sad', 'angry','fearful', 'disgust','surprised'. <br>
## Feature Extracted(using Librosa):
#### mel spectrogram 
A spectrogram where the frequencies are converted to the mel scale. 
#### Chroma features
In music, the term chroma feature or chromagram closely relates to the twelve different pitch classes. Chroma-based features, which are also referred to as “pitch class profiles”, are a powerful tool for analyzing music whose pitches can be meaningfully categorized (often into twelve categories) and whose tuning approximates to the equal-tempered scale. One main property of chroma features is that they capture harmonic and melodic characteristics of music, while being robust to changes in timbre and instrumentation. 

#### MFCC (Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients):
Any sound generated by humans is determined by the shape of their vocal tract (including tongue, teeth, etc). If this shape can be determined correctly, any sound produced can be accurately represented. The envelope of the time power spectrum of the speech signal is representative of the vocal tract and MFCC (which is nothing but the coefficients that make up the Mel-frequency cepstrum) accurately represents this envelope.
